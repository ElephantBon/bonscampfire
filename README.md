# Bon's Campfire

A simple campfire made based on CustomNpcs.

This mod only adds a block that is campfire.
The campfire works like furnace, looks like campfire.

Get started:
1. Put burnable fuel into campfire. (Fuels like coal, wood, planks...)
2. Start fire with flint or flint and steel. (Fire can be put down by sand)
3. Sit beside the campfire and watch it burn. (Campfire consume fuel even if their is nothing to cook)
4. Let some meat cooked on campfire. (The fire could be ineffective and need a lot time to finish the cooking)
5. Make sure there are enough fuel, or the fire will be weaker. (Less light and more time for cooked meat)
